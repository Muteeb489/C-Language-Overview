1 IntroductionIn computer science, different languages can be learned and used in developing websites,applications, and many more. When it comes to ”most used”, the C++ language liesin the 4th position. C++ is a top programming language that is favored for creatinghigh-performance software [Menon, 2023]. The C++ programming language was createdby Danish computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop at Bell Laboratories in 1979 and releasedin 1895 for commercial use. However, since C++ is an attempt to add object-orientedfeatures to the C language, before it was named C++ in 1983, it was called ”C with objects”with the goal of surpassing the C language. The name C++ suggests ”C incremented”,++ is an increment operator of C [Bhave Patekar,2012].As an enhanced version of the C programming language, C++ is a high-level, general-purpose computer language. It was developed with the intention of giving programmersa strong and adaptable tool for creating intricate software systems while keeping C’seffectiveness and low-level control. It supports a range of programming paradigms, suchas procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, in order to achieve these goals.It offers a wide range of capabilities that enable programmers to write code that is botheffective and expressive, including templates, exceptions, and operator overloading.
2Aljas, J., Amores, H., Lincopinis, D.: An Overview on C++ Programming LanguageOperating systems, device drivers, embedded systems, video games, and other high-performance software applications are all frequently developed using C++.2Why C++ is Popular Compared to other Programming Languages?The finest programming language is also the one that is easiest to learn, and when high-level capabilities are available, it is one of the best languages for anyone to begin learningto program. When starting to learn on how to program, it is best to start with C++, forother languages have the same syntax and structures that added to the advantage to theprogrammer to learn other languages. C++ is a powerful and versatile language thatoffers a lot of flexibility and performance. Its combination of efficiency, object-orientedprogramming, cross-platform compatibility, and a large community makes it a popularchoice for software development.–EfficiencyHigh-performance languages like C++ enable effective memory management, whichis crucial for programs that need to run quickly and make the most of their resources.It is frequently employed in fields including embedded devices, operating systems,and game development.–Object-oriented programmingC++ one of the programming languages that is an object-oriented programming,which employs encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to enable developersto create elaborate and modular applications.–Cross-platform compatibilityC++ can be used to develop applications for multiple platforms, including Windows,Linux, and macOS.–Large community and supportSince C++ has been around for more than 30 years, there is a sizable community ofdevelopers who continue to work on and support it.–FlexibilityApplication areas for C++ include system programming, game development, scien-tific computing, and web development.–Legacy codeC++ is used in many legacy applications and systems, making it an important skillfor software developers to have.3 Features of C++ Programming LanguageThe programming language appeal comes from its features. Features of programminglanguage matters especially in developing software, games, applications, and etc., for thefeatures help the developer to be more advanced in constructing their code, and efficient.Though the C++ is a complex language to use, its features, especially the syntax, is whatit makes famous and useful to developers. With the addition of new capabilities, thewell-known C programming language is expanded into C++, which is more effective,adaptable, and scalable. In the following paragraphs are the C++’s essential features thatcontribute to its widespread use and broad range of applications [GeeksforGeeks, 2021].
Aljas, J., Amores, H., Lincopinis, D.: An Overview on C++ Programming Language 31. Object-Oriented ProgrammingC++ is an object-oriented programming language that allows for the creation anddestruction of objects, as well as the production of blueprints to create them. It is aprocedural programming language. Object-oriented includes:(a) ClassIt is a user-defined data type that programmers used to have a more organizedstructure of code that is basically composed of variables and functions. A C++class functions as an object’s blueprint (C++ classes and objects, n.d.).(b) Objectis an example of a Class. It is what form the class of the code that have a specificfunctionality (units of code). No memory is allocated when a class is specified,but it is allocated when it gets created (i.e., when an object is formed).(c) Inheritancefrom one class, inheritance occurs when reusing of code from the class declaredhappens. Inheritance is only applicable if the functionality of the code stays thesame.(d) Encapsulationthe collection of information and data in a single package. Encapsulation meansbringing together the data and functions where manipulation is present or ob-served to object-oriented programming.(e) PolymorphismPolymorphism is the ability of a message to be presented in multiple presenta-tions, and can occur in compile-time and run-time forms.(f) Abstractionit is the process of not disclosing the code structure to others on how the programis implemented, especially civilized person.2. Machine IndependentC++ executable is machine-independent but not platform-independent, meaning itcan run on any operating system, however, other operating systems are excluded.3. SimpleIt is a simple programming language with a library support system, logical unit andcomponent division, and Auto Keyword.4. PopularMost of the applications, websites, and any software or hardware components usethe C++ language like Adobe Photoshop, YouTube, Amazon, and many more. Itis also popular for beginner programmers to start with this language that builds thefoundation in understanding the syntax and way of constructing programs beforeproceeding to another language.5. Case-SensitiveSensitive to letter capitalization in text or written input. For instance, ”Computer” and”computer” are two distinct words since the ”C” in the first example is capitalizedwhile it is lowercase in the second.
4Aljas, J., Amores, H., Lincopinis, D.: An Overview on C++ Programming Language6. Compiler BasedC++ code must be compiled before it can be executed, which involves creating atext file and passing it into a compiler to convert it into machine code.7. Dynamic Memory Allocation- Uses the new and delete keywords to help programmers allocate and deallocatememory while the program is running.8. Memory Management- With “new” and “delete” operators, the language can dynamically allocate memoryand vice versa. It manages the memory to avoid crushed applications.9. Multi-Threading- A thread is the smallest unit of programming that is controlled by the scheduler,allowing an operating system to construct a process with multiple threads.4 10 Reasons to Learn C++ Programming LanguageThis approximately 40-year-old language has been used in numerous projects and soft-ware problems. One of the best programming languages is C++, which is used whencreating high-performance software. The following paragraphs are the 10 reasons tolearn C++ programming [Menon, 2023]:1. Popularity and High SalaryOne of the frequently used languages. Around 4.4 million developers utilize itglobally. Additionally, C++ developer’s population increases due to the demand,with an average salary of 103, 035 dollars per year.2. Abundant Library SupportStandard Template Library (STL) in C++ consists of four parts: iterators, containers,functions, and algorithms. Iterators can be used to work on data structures, whilefunctors/functions enable customization of the associated function’s operation.3. Large CommunityThere is a large online community of C++ professionals and users, as well as severalonline resources such as GeeksforGeeks, StackOverflow, and Standard.4. For DatabasesEvery C++ and C are used to create major operating systems, such as Windows,Linux, Android, Ubuntu, and iOS. Android applications are written in Java, C/C++,and non-default run-times for C++ support, while Windows applications are writtenin C++.5. For CompilersC++ is a relatively low-level language that is closer to the hardware level. Thisjustifies its widespread use as a backend programming language in compilers. TheGNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which is presently primarily developed in C++along with C, is an example of this.
