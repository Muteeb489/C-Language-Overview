Abstract:C++ (said C plus plus) is an object-oriented computer language created by notablecomputer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages (Rouse,2021). It was developed as a cross-platform improvement of C to provide developers with a higherdegree of control over memory and system resources. It is a useful language for object-orientedprogramming, procedural and functional programming, and software development, with highflexibility and scalability â€” that allows developers to create programs that can run on differentoperating systems or platforms. In this paper, we introduce the C++ programming language, ex-plain why C++ programming is popular among other languages, and discuss some features ofthis language. Some other features are included in this paper to help you easily understand C++programming. This includes ten reasons to learn and the various applications of C++ programming.Keywords:C++, Object-oriented, Cross-platform, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Stan-dard Template Library (STL), High Flexibility, Scalability, and Low-level Manipulation
